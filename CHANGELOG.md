*   Automatically decorate the status and result logs with the host's UUID and hostname.

*   Fix an issue where Kolide users on Safari were unable to delete queries or packs.

*   Improve platform detection accuracy.

    Previously Kolide was determing platform based on the OS of the system osquery

    may continue to report an erroneous platform until they check-in with Kolide.

*   Improve security for user-initiated email address changes.

    This improvement ensures that only users who own an email address and are
    logged in as the user who initiated the change can confirm the new email.

    Previously it was possible for Administrators to also confirm these changes
    by clicking the confirmation link.

    This change resolves an issue where certain special characters like "."
    where rejected by the client-side JS that controls the setup form.
