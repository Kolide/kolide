Application Documentation
=========================

Kolide is an application that allows you to take advantage of the power of osquery in order to maintain constant insight into the state of your infrastructure (security, health, stability, performance, compliance, etc). The application documentation contains documents on the following topics:

## Using The Kolide application

- For information on running osquery queries on hosts in your infrastructure, you can refer to the [Running Queries](./running-queries.md) page.
- To learn more about scheduling queries for periodic execution on select hosts, managing query packs, etc, you can refer to the [Scheduling Queries](./scheduling-queries.md) page.
- Kolide also allows you to configure osquery options so that you can endlessly customize your osquery usage. For information on how to customize osquery using Kolide as well as thoughts on what customization you might consider performing, see the [Configuring Osquery Options](./configuring-osquery-options.md) documentation.

## Working With osquery logs

Kolide makes it easy to schedule queries, curate packs, and generate a lot of osquery logs. For more information on how you can access these logs as well as examples on what you can do with them, see the [Working With Osquery Logs](./working-with-osquery-logs.md) documentation.
