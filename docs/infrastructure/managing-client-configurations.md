Managing Client Configurations
==============================

We recommend that you use an infrastructure configuration management tool to manage these osquery configurations consistently across your environment. If you're unsure about what configuration management tools your organization uses, contact your company's system administrators. If you are evaluating new solutions for this problem, the founders of Kolide have successfully managed configurations in large production environments using [Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef/) and [Puppet](https://puppet.com/).
