## Filing issues

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Fleet are you using (`fleet version --full`)?
2. What operating system are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to happen?
5. What happened instead?

Sensitive security-related issues should be reported to
[security@kolide.co](mailto:security@kolide.co) before a public issue is made.
