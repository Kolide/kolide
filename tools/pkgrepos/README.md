Creating a new release
==================

Releases must be built locally(for now) because packages have to be signed and we're not in a position to trust a public CI system with signing keys.
Once packages are built and dep/apt repos are generated, the repo is synced to a GCS cloud bucket which makes the release immediately available at `dl.kolide.com`

# Requirements

A local copy of the google storage bucket. `gs://dl.kolide.co/`
GPG keys in your keyring. 

# Steps

1. Download the Google Storage bucket locally. 
```
gsutil cp -r gs://dl.kolide.co/ /Users/$user/kolide_packages/
```

2. Import keys to GPG keyring. Run this command by mounting the ~/.gnupg folder into the `kolide/fpm` docker container. The gnupg version on your mac is probably different and the keyring format is not compatible with the one in the container.

Note: You only need to do this step once.

Start container
```
	docker run --rm -it \
        -v /Users/$(whoami)/.gnupg:/root/.gnupg" \
        kolide/fpm /bin/bash
```

And in the container, run:

```
gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import private.key
```

Then check the key is there, with `gpg --list-keys`
You should see the Kolide packaging key there.


3. Build binaries/packages.
Use the `build_release.sh` script in this folder to create a zip of the binaries and linux packages. The scripts for building linux packages will run in a docker container, so if you're running for the first time, you might see the containers downloading. 

You will be prompted for the GPG password several times by the rpm/deb packaging scripts.  

4. Copy the artifacts into the appropriate directories in `~/kolide_packages`

Example: 
```
cp build/kolide-1.0.4-1.x86_64.rpm ~/kolide_packages/yum/
cp build/kolide_1.0.4_amd64.deb ~/kolide_packages/deb                                                                                         
cp build/kolide_1.0.4.zip ~/kolide_packages/bin                                                                                                
cp build/kolide_latest.zip ~/kolide_packages/bin/kolide_latest.zip                                                                            
```

5. Run the `update-package-repos` script. The script will update/sign the metadata for the local yum/apt repos. You will be prompted for the GPG key password again during this step so have it ready. 
The script assumes the packages are in `LOCAL_REPO_PATH="/Users/${USER}/kolide_packages"`

NOTE: The script MUST be run from the `pkgrepos` directory as it `cd`s into relative folders. Should probably be fixed...

6. Generate the package metadate file. 
The `https://dl.kolide.co/metadata.json` file holds data about the latest version/old releases. Run the Go `package_metadata.go` to generate an updated version of the metadata file.
```
go run package_metadata.go -repo /Users/$me/kolide_packages/ -git-tag=1.0.4
 ```

7. Create a git commit commit with the updated package repos. 
The repo building scripts can be flaky, and occasionaly it's useful to use a `--reset HARD` flag with git to retry building the release.

8. Push the release to gcloud. Pushing will override the contents of the gcs bucket and the release will be immediately available.

```
gsutil -m rsync -r -d ./kolide_packages gs://dl.kolide.co/
```

# Testing

The `~/kolide_packages` folder has a nginx dockerfile which builds a static site of the repo. You can use it to host a local version of the yum/apt repo.
